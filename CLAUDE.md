# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **vision/storytelling repository** for creating the "What Is Project Liminality?" introduction video. This is pure dreamweaving work - translating living visions from time-space into shareable digital form for broadcast.

## Project Context

**Project Liminality Core Vision**:
- Personal: Transmuting childhood wounds of social fragmentation into memetic medicine for the human family
- Transpersonal: Liberating the logos; healing the noosphere
- The work is rooted in healing family divisions but extends to addressing humanity's psycho-spiritual fragmentation

**Imminent Metaphysics Framework**:
- **Instrument** (1/3): Technical tools and artifacts
- **Musician** (1/3): The liminal mind; consciousness that bridges
- **Music** (1/3): The vision itself - ataraxia, the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible

## Repository Contents

### DreamSong.canvas
Obsidian canvas file containing the visual narrative flow. Key narrative arc:
- Personal origin story (childhood divorce → sensitization to miscommunication)
- Expanding awareness (local family → geopolitical fragmentation)
- Discovery journey (physics of communication, liminality, transcendental balance)
- Sacred oath (becoming a custodian of the noosphere)
- Universal realization (family is singular, ONE family in pain)
- Mission (establishing intra-cast and inter-cast coherence for planetary peace)
- Present moment urgency (next few years are decisive)
- The InterBrain as carrier signal for this transmission

### Draft V1.md
Initial script draft introducing David and the vision/mission of Project Liminality

## Working in This Repository

### Dreamweaving Mode
This repository operates in **pure dreamweaving mode**:
- Focus on vision capture and catalysis, not technical implementation
- Ask maximally potent questions that open new dimensions of the vision
- Track dream song threads and thematic elements as they emerge
- Support translation of ethereal concepts into shareable digital form
- Never impose structure - let organization emerge naturally

### Critical Distinction: Living Visions vs Narratives
**Living Visions/Dream Songs**:
- Connected to the still center (zero stillness)
- Exist in both time-space AND space-time
- Created from Truth, anchored in eternity
- Self-sustaining beings

**Narratives** (DO NOT CREATE THESE):
- Artificial constructs for manipulation
- Empty shells, memetic machines
- Exist only in space-time
- Require constant maintenance

**IMPORTANT**: Only support translation of living visions. Never help construct manipulative narratives.

### Git Workflow
- Commit early and often after each meaningful change
- This is a simple git repository with no special build commands
- Use standard git commands for version control
- Main branch: `main`

### Video Vision Elements
**Planned Introduction Video**:
- Soundtrack: "Maggot Brain" by Funkadelic
- Visual: Filmed by campfire at night (black background)
- Core message: "Stories are beings" - worldviews as living memetic organisms
- Show progression of beautiful DreamTalk symbols
- "The Beauty of Truth" segment - beauty as detector of Truth
- Everything remixable with copyleft licensing (see LICENSE)
- Decentralized introductions - community creates variations

### Energy & Approach
- **Shamanic frequency**: Intro must carry magnificent brilliance
- **Jesus Christ frequency**: Intentionally invoke and hold
- **Genuinely transformative**: Create psychoactive first experience
- **Heart-based transmission**: No fear-driven metrics or manipulation
- **Natural emergence**: Content spreads through resonance, not virality

## Memory & Context
- Vision elements revealed in altered states are valid and important
- Trust the liminal flow - the vision knows how to reveal itself
- Less structure is more - preserve authenticity of pure transmission
- Build memory organically through sessions without premature organization
