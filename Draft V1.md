Hi, I'm David

I wanted to take a moment to clarify the vision and mission of Project Liminality

The project has both a personal and a transpersonal dimension

On a personal level, PL is my own journey of transmuting childhood wounds of social fragmentation into memetic medicine for the human family

On a trans-personal level it is about liberating the logos

In my early childhood my parents divorced which created a rift right at the centre of my family field
this story is by no means unique and I'm far from the only one experiencing something like this

only a decade later this rift started to increasingly act as surface area for the geopolitical propaganda to land on which exacerbated the existing division into a multipolar mess
