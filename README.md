# Project Liminality

**Transmuting childhood wounds of social fragmentation into memetic medicine for the human family.**

## The Vision

Project Liminality emerged from a personal wound—the divorce of my parents created a rift that sensitized me to the pains of social fragmentation and miscommunication. Years later, polarizing topics landed on this rift, forcing me to hold conflicting perspectives without being able to choose a side.

This led to a discovery: just as there is really only one crisis on this planet (the meta-crisis), there is really only one family—the human family. And the way stories flow through and shape collectives—what I call the **Logos**—constitutes the highest leverage point for healing or harming any society.

## The Threefold Essence

Project Liminality is an art project with three dimensions:

- **The Instrument**: The InterBrain—a communication medium tuned to filter manipulative narratives while amplifying unifying visions
- **The Musician**: Liminal Mind—the undomesticated, indigenous type of mind capable of holding paradox and integrating conflicting perspectives
- **The Music**: The Age of Miracles—the inevitable outcome of liminal minds self-organizing to bring about healing at exponential scale

## Core Insight

> **Stories are beings.**
> If we use them, they use us.
> If we serve them, they serve us.

Domesticated mind sees stories as dead tools for manipulation. Liminal mind perceives stories as living beings with which we co-create reality.

**Narratives** mediate parasitic relationships.
**Visions** mediate symbiotic relationships.

## The Mission

**Liberate the Logos so the Logos can liberate the Human Family.**

If we can bind the weaponization of the Logos and restore balance to our communication, humanity will reach what has been called the phase shift, the omega point, the human singularity—I call it the **Symbiotic Convergence**.
